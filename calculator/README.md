## Calculator README

### Basic Calculator
This project uses classes, methods, and objects to create a simple arithmetic calculator. The calculator can: 

*   Add two integers
*   Subtract two integers
*   Multiply two integers
*   Divide two integers
*   Apply the modulo operator on two integers

**Note** The `main` method is defined manually and is templatized during the creation of the `calculator` class
Ex:

```java
public class Template {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.print("This is a basic template");
  }
}
```

## DNA Sequencing 

This project uses String methods to determine whether a string meets the criteria necessary to be considered a strand of DNA.

The requirements are:


A protein (stored as a String integer) has the following qualities:

*   It begins with a “start codon”: **ATG**.
*   It ends with a “stop codon”: **TGA**.
*   In between, each additional codon is a sequence of three nucleotides.
